This machine learning project walks through step by step process of building a real estate price prediction model. A model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com is built. During model building the following are the data science concepts covered, such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. 
Technology and tools wise this project covers,

1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
